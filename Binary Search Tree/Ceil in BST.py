'''
You are given a root binary search tree and an integer x . Your task is to find the Ceil of x in the tree.
Note: Ceil(x) is a number that is either equal to x or is immediately greater than x.
If Ceil could not be found, return -1.

Examples:
Input: root = [5, 1, 7, N, 2, N, N, N, 3], x = 3
Output: 3
Explanation: We find 3 in BST, so ceil of 3 is 3.

Input: root = [10, 5, 11, 4, 7, N, N, N, N, N, 8], x = 6
Output: 7
Explanation: We find 7 in BST, so ceil of 6 is 7.
You are given a root binary search tree and an integer x . Your task is to find the Ceil of x in the tree.
