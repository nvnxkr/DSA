# Given a circular integer array nums (i.e., the next element of nums[nums.length - 1] is nums[0]), return the next greater number for every element in nums.
# The next greater number of a number x is the first greater number to its traversing-order next in the array, which means you could search circularly to find its next greater number. If it doesn't exist, return -1 for this number.

# Example 1:

# Input: nums = [1,2,1]
# Output: [2,-1,2]
# Explanation: The first 1's next greater number is 2; 
# The number 2 can't find next greater number. 
# The second 1's next greater number needs to search circularly, which is also 2.
