'''
You are given an integer array nums of length n and an integer k.

For each index i, define its instability score as max(nums[0..i]) - min(nums[i..n - 1]).

In other words:

max(nums[0..i]) is the largest value among the elements from index 0 to index i.
min(nums[i..n - 1]) is the smallest value among the elements from index i to index n - 1.
An index i is called stable if its instability score is less than or equal to k.

Return the smallest stable index. If no such index exists, return -1.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [5,0,1,4], k = 3

Output: 3

Explanation:

At index 0: The maximum in [5] is 5, and the minimum in [5, 0, 1, 4] is 0, so the instability score is 5 - 0 = 5.
At index 1: The maximum in [5, 0] is 5, and the minimum in [0, 1, 4] is 0, so the instability score is 5 - 0 = 5.
At index 2: The maximum in [5, 0, 1] is 5, and the minimum in [1, 4] is 1, so the instability score is 5 - 1 = 4.
At index 3: The maximum in [5, 0, 1, 4] is 5, and the minimum in [4] is 4, so the instability score is 5 - 4 = 1.
This is the first index with an instability score less than or equal to k = 3. Thus, the answer is 3.

class Solution:
    def firstStableIndex(self, nums: list[int], k: int) -> int:
        n = len(nums)
        mini = [-1] * n
        # maxi = [-1] * n
        maxi = nums[0]
        mini[n - 1] = nums[n - 1]

        # for i in range(1, n):
        #     maxi[i] = max(maxi[i - 1], nums[i])

        for i in range(n - 2, -1, -1):
            mini[i] = min(mini[i + 1], nums[i])

        for i in range(n):
            maxi = max(maxi, nums[i])
            small = maxi - mini[i]
            if small <= k:
                return i
        return -1
