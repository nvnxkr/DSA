"""
You are given an array, arr[]. Find the minimum index based distance between two different elements of the array, x and y. Return -1, if either x or y does not exist in the array.

Examples:

Input: arr[] = [1, 2, 3, 2], x = 1, y = 2
Output: 1
Explanation: x = 1 and y = 2. There are two distances between x and y, which are 1 and 3 out of which the least is 1.
Input: arr[] = [86, 39, 90, 67, 84, 66, 62], x = 42, y = 12
Output: -1
Explanation: x = 42 and y = 12. We return -1 as x and y don't exist in the array.
Input: arr[] = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50], x = 10, y = 50
Output: 4
Explanation: The distance between x = 10 (index 0) and y = 50 (index 4) is 4, which is the only distance between them.
Constraints:
1 <= arr.size() <= 105
0 <= arr[i], x, y <= 105
x != y
