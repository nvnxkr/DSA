Given three integers x, y, and bound, return a list of all the powerful integers that have a value less than or equal to bound.

An integer is powerful if it can be represented as xi + yj for some integers i >= 0 and j >= 0.

You may return the answer in any order. In your answer, each value should occur at most once.

 

Example 1:

Input: x = 2, y = 3, bound = 10
Output: [2,3,4,5,7,9,10]
Explanation:
2 = 20 + 30
3 = 21 + 30
4 = 20 + 31
5 = 21 + 31
7 = 22 + 31
9 = 23 + 30
10 = 20 + 32
Example 2:

Input: x = 3, y = 5, bound = 15
Output: [2,4,6,8,10,14]

                if x + y <= bound:
                    ans.add(x + y)

        return list(ans)
